# Mindmaps

This project explores two approaches for creating mind maps:

1. **Automated Approach**  
   - Scrape data from the web.  
   - Write Python code to convert the scraped data into a PlantUML script.  
   - Save the script as `plantuml.puml` and generate the mind map from it.  

2. **AI-Assisted Approach**  
   - Collect all the scraped links.  
   - Use ChatGPT to generate code for the mind map.  
   - Run the generated code using `mindMap_maker.py` to produce the final output.
